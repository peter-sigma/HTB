In this process, we identify the server and open ports.
There are 65535. 1-1023, are reserved for Privileged services.


Nmap
Stands for network mapper. It is used for a variety of tasks including network scanning. For a simple scan, we use the command:
 nmap 10.129.42.254
 Ater running command, We get 3 headings i.e port, state and service. Port name the port number, state show us whether it is open, 
 clossed or filtered, service shows us the service running in the port. 
 By default, Nmap will conduct a TCP scan unless specifically requested to perform a UDP scan.
 We can use the -sC (scripts) and -sV (os version) -p- (scan all the ports) to get more information.
  nmap -sV -sC -p- 10.129.42.254

 nmap -sV --script=banner 10.129.42.254
 FTP
It is worth gaining familiarity with FTP, as it is a standard protocol, and this service can often contain interesting data. 
A Nmap scan of the default port for FTP (21) reveals the vsftpd 3.0.3 installation that we identified previously. Further, 
it also reports that anonymous authentication is enabled and that a pub directory is available.
nmap -sC -sV -p21 10.129.42.254
ftp -p 10.129.42.253

SMB
SMB (Server Message Block) is a prevalent protocol on Windows machines that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement. 
Sensitive data, including credentials, can be in network file shares, and some SMB versions may be vulnerable to RCE exploits such as 
EternalBlue. It is crucial to enumerate this sizeable potential attack surface carefully. Nmap has many scripts for enumerating SMB, 
such as smb-os-discovery.nse, which will interact with the SMB service to extract the reported operating system version.
nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 10.129.42.254
nmap -A -p445 10.129.42.254
smbclient \\\\10.129.42.254\\users
smbclient -U admin \\\\10.129.42.254\\users ->got login credentials from login.txt acquired earlier using ftp
